# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What problem does the context API help solve?
The Context Api helps solve the issue of sharing state down the tree and helps prevent prop drilling. 

2. In your own words, describe `actions`, `reducers` and the `store` and their role in Redux. What does each piece do? Why is the store known as a 'single source of truth' in a redux application?
Store is a centralized container for state which is why its known as the single source of truth .
Store Holds the App data
Reducer: is what manipulates the dara when an action is received
Action : is what tells reducer to manipulate the stored data
3. What does `redux-thunk` allow us to do? How does it change our `action-creators`?
redux-thunk allows us to make action creators that return a outer function and not a action 
This allows us to write condtional dispatches.
4. What is your favorite state management system you've learned and this sprint? Please explain why!
my favorite state management system is redux because it is pretty easy to test and not too many callbacks which can get really confusing.
